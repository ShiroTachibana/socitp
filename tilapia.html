            The fast-growing and prolific tilapia is among the most important aquaculture commodities in the world. It grows fast, easily breeds in captivity, and is tolerant of various environments and culture systems. Propagating and farming this fish requires little input and the technology can be simple and easily adaptable by small-scale fish farmers. Investors also find tilapia farming to be profitable because of its fairly low investment cost and good feeding efficiency in lakes and ponds where natural food are available. These fish are also invasive species in some countries </p>
